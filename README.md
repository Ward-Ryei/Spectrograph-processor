Mass spectrometry data processing and plotting
Frist of all, you should download the lipid database msp file from http://prime.psc.riken.jp/compms/msdial/download/lipidblast/MSDIAL-TandemMassSpectralAtlas-VS69-Pos.msp. After that, the msp file was pretreated by 'msp_db_process', and you can get the PC and SM database that was used for the next step.
the ms data was processed by 'peek_picker'. And you can generate the PCA and LDA's confusion matrix with the help of the 'figure_drawing'.
